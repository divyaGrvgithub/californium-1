<!-- Branch for this assignment is assignment/get-api -->

1- Create an API for GET /movies that returns a list of movies. Define an array of movies in your code and return the value in response.
	
2- Create an API GET /movies/:indexNumber (For example GET /movies/1 is a valid request and it should return the movie in your array at index 1). You can define an array of movies again in your api


[‘Rang de basanti’, ‘The shining’, ‘Lord of the rings’, ‘Batman begins’]


Example of a request url -> localhost:3000/movies/2


3- Handle a scenario in problem 2 where if the index is greater than the valid maximum value a message is returned that tells the user to use a valid index in an error message.

4- Write another api called GET /films. Instead of an array of strings define an array of movie objects this time. Each movie object should have values - id, name. An example of movies array is 
[ {
 “id”: 1,
 “name”: “The Shining”
}, {
 “id”: 2,
 “name”: “Incendies”
}, {
 “id”: 3,
 “name”: “Rang de Basanti”
}, {
 “id”: 4,
 “name”: “Finding Nemo”
}]

Return the entire array in this api’s response


5- Write api GET /films/:filmId where filmId is the value received in request path params. Use this value to return a movie object with this id. In case there is no such movie present in the array, return a suitable message in the response body. Example for a request GET /films/3 should return the movie object 
{
 “id”: 3,
 “name”: “Rang de Basanti”
}
Similarly for a request GET /films/9 the response can be something like - ‘No movie exists with this id’
